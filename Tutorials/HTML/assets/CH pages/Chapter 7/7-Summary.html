    <ul>
      <li>Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.</li>

      <li>Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.</li>

      <li>Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.</li>

      <li> HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.</li>
