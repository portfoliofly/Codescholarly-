    <ul>
      <li> HTML pages are text documents. </li>

      <li> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning. </li>

      <li> Tags are often referred to as elements </li>

      <li> Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end. </li>

      <li> Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.</li>

      <li> Attributes require a name and a value </li>

      <li> To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go. </li>
